To do:
> Add comments.
> Make the program more user-friendly. Examples of what to do:
>> The program disallows the user to not enter any password when created an account.
>> The program disallows the user to not enter any category when entering a transaction.
>> The program makes the user's entered category lowercase, ALWAYS.
>> The program disallows the user from entering NOTHING in the account creation menu.
> Then start working on categories
> Then start working on statistics.
